This project is a VR escape room set in a fantasy dungeon environment. The goal is to help the skulls in the game be more comfortable in exchange for your freedom. The purpose is to create an interactive and immersive escape room experience that rivals real life escape room fun. You will learn to move around with teleport, pick and throw around objects, and interact with controls to solve basic puzzles.
